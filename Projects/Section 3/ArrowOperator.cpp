 //The arrow operator (->) is a dereference operator that is used exclusively with pointers to objects that have members.
 //This operator serves to access the member of an object directly from its address. For example, in the example above:
pmovie->title

	


is, for all purposes, equivalent to:

 

	

(*pmovie).title
